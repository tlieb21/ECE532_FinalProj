To run the Ridge Regression and K-Nearest Neighbor code, simply run the Jupyter Notebooks.

To run the Neural Network code, PyTorch and TensorFlow packages must first be installed. Then simply run the Python3 file.


The PDF files are the project proposal and updates from during implementation. The DEV folder has all the files/code from
during development.
